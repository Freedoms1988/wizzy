**Status Update:** A rewrite is in progress since the current code is very hard to maintain and most functionnalities are broken with newer grafana versions. Existing pull requests will not be merged, feel free to fork if your needs are urgent. More details coming soon about the new version.

`wizzy` is a rich user-friendly command line tool written in node.js to manage Grafana entities. It can save you hundreds of clicks in a day when editing and managing your Grafana dashboards. It can also be used to store dashboards in a Github repo making Grafana dashboards version controlled.
